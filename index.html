         <li>Marker Chips: 50 green, 50 blue, 25 red </li>
       </ul>

       <h2> Objective </h2>
         <ul>
            <li>The goal is to make a connected series, or “Sequence,” of 5 same-colored chips either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on the board.
            </li>
            <li>For <strong>2 players or 2 teams</strong>: One player or team must complete <strong>two Sequences</strong> before their opponents.
            </li>
            <li>For <strong>3 players or 3 teams</strong>: One player or team must complete <strong>one Sequences</strong> before their opponents.
            </li>
         </ul>
         
      <h2> Setup </h2>
         <h3>Teams</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>2-12 players are allowed as long as the number of players is divisible by 2 or 3 (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, or 12 players). Up to 3 players may play as individuals, otherwise teams must be formed. No more than 3 teams can play.</li>
            </ul>
           
         <h3>Board</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Place the game board on a flat surface with space around the game board for marker chips and discard piles for each player. </li>
            </ul>

         <h3>Player Positions</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>For <strong>2 players or 2 teams</strong>: Players are evenly divided into teams. Opponents sit in alternating positions around the playing surface.
               </li>
               <li> For <strong>3 players or 3 teams</strong>: Players are evenly divided into teams. Opponents sit in alternating positions around the playing surface.</li>
            </ul>

         <h3>Marker Chip Distribution</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>For <strong>2 teams</strong>, each team receives either green or blue marker chips (50 each).
               </li>
               <li> For <strong>3 teams</strong>, each team receives green, blue, or red marker chips (25 each).
               </li>
            </ul>
            
         <h3>Card Distribution</h3>
            <ul>
               <li> Players cut the cards.
               </li>
               <li> The player who obtains the lowest card is the dealer (2 is the lowest card; Ace is the highest card).
               </li>
               <li>The dealer shuffles the cards and deals an equal number to each player:
                  <ul>
                     <li>2 players: 7 cards each</li>
                     <li>3 or 4 players: 6 cards each
                     </li>
                     <li>6 players: 5 cards each
                     </li>
                     <li>8 or 9 players: 4 cards each
                     </li>
                     <li>10 or 12 players: 3 cards each
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>The dealer puts aside the leftover cards to be used as a draw deck. </li>
            </ul>
      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <h3>Game Rules</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>The player to the left of the dealer chooses a card from their hand and places it face-up in front of them. This will be their discard pile.</li>
            <li>The card placed in the discard pile will have two matching cards printed on the game board. The player may place one marker chip on a printed card, as long as there is no marker chip already present.</li>
            <li>For the use of Dead Cards (when there are no free spaces left to place a marker chip) or Jacks (which are not pictured on the board), see “Dead Cards” and “Jacks” below.
            </li>
            <li>Once a marker chip is placed on the board, the player must remember to draw a card from the draw deck and add it to their hand before the next player finishes their turn, or else they lose their right to draw a card.
            </li>
            <li>Players continue as outlined above in a clockwise direction until one player or team makes the required number of Sequences, at which point that player or team wins the game. If two Sequences are required to win, the second Sequence may contain one chip from the first Sequence.</li>
         </ul>
      <h3>Dead Cards</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>If a player’s hand contains a card which does not have an open space on the board, this is called a Dead Card and may be turned in for a new card.
         </li>
         <li>To turn in a Dead Card for a new card, the Dead Card is placed on the discard pile, announced as a “Dead Card,” and then a replacement is taken from the draw deck and added to the player’s hand. Only one Dead Card may be turned in per turn. The player may then proceed with their turn.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Jacks</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>The four Jacks with two eyes (Diamond and Club Jacks) are called Wild Cards. To play a Wild Card, the player must place it on the discard pile, and then may place one of their marker chips on any open space on the board.
         </li>
         <li>The four Jacks with one eye (Heart and Spade Jacks) are called Anti-wild Cards. To play an Anti-wild Card, the player must place it on the discard pile, and then may remove one of the opponents’ marker chips from the board. Marker chips that are already part of a Sequence cannot be removed. 
         </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bonus Spaces</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>There are marker chips pictured in each corner of the game board. These are bonus spaces. Players may use them as though their color marker chip is in the corner. When using a corner, only 4 marker chips are required to complete a Sequence. More than one player or team may use the same corner as part of a Sequence.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Table talk or coaching team members is forbidden. If table talk or coaching occurs, each member of that team must forfeit one card of their choice from their hand and place it on their discard pile.
         </li>
         <li>When the draw deck runs out, all discard piles must be shuffled together to create a new draw deck.</li>
      </ul>
